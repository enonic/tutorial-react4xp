Layouts are essentially parts with regions, providing another layer of flexibility for page composition.


== Task: Add layout rendering

Adding layouts is more or less identical to pages and parts. Unsurprisingly, HMDB already contains sample pages that uses layouts, specifically a `2-column` layout.

Follow the steps below:

. *Add the `2-column` layout* files:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/layouts/TwoColumn.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/layouts/TwoColumn.tsx[]
----
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/layouts/TwoColumn.module.css
[source,CSS]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/layouts/TwoColumn.module.css[]
----
. *Register the component:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/componentRegistry.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}layout/componentRegistry.tsx[]
----
+
. *The result*:
By combining layout, part and text we are starting to see the potential of the page editor:

TIP: Like parts, layouts also support processors. Use `.addLayout` instead of `.addPart`.

== Optional task: Build a page from scratch

So far you have seen pre-defined pages. You may also try building your own page from scratch - using the components that are now available.

TIP: Create a new `folder` within the site structure, click the preview field and choose `Customize`.

Wrapping up, we'll have a look at <<page-templates#, page templates>>.
