== Lesson 6 overview

This final example is going to be more real-life-like. We'll focus on these features:

- Using an entry from a *myEntries* folder outside of the _site/_ structure
- Letting the entry itself *import and nest its own react components*. Imports like this are just regular frontend ES6, and happen at compile time, done by webpack.
- Importing those secondary assets from a shared non-entry folder, and marking that folder so everything in it is turned into a separate bundle - a *dependency chunk*. These chunks are repeatedly-used, effectively-cached and rarely-downloaded "library assets" of shared secondary components. They're meant to take care of bigger stuff while keeping the footprint of the entry small (while still automatically compiled and tracked by react4xp).
- Our react components will need some compilation that react4xp doesn't handle: styling our react components (but it could be anything on the webpack step: asset handling, loaders etc). So we'll see how to *add custom webpack config* to the react4xp setup.

As you can see, there are more moving parts than before to coordinate here, so we'll divide the code into *three sections*:

- an XP part at the core of things, fetching editorial data from XP and inserting it into a react4xp entry - as before,
- the entries and imported assets under _react4xp/_,
- and adaptations to the react4xp config, which will enable webpack handling of styles and enable the Part controller to find and use the entry and its imports the way we want.


{zwsp} +

== The _multi-color_ Part

Starting out with the _multi-color_ Part at the core of it all, everything in this section will probably be familiar by now.

{zwsp} +

=== Part definition
The Part definition enables two editorial configurations:

.site/parts/multi-color/multi-color.xml:
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part>
    <display-name>Multi-Color</display-name>
    <description>Add your own clickable colors</description>

    <form>
        <input name="SSR" type="CheckBox">          <!--1-->
            <label>Server-side rendering</label>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1"/>
        </input>

        <input name="colors" type="TextLine">       <!--2-->
            <label>Color</label>
            <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0"/>
        </input>
    </form>
</part>
----
<1> a checkbox for making the entry serverside or clientside rendered,
<2> and an array of colors where a user in Content Studio can add any number of HTML-compliant color tags.

{zwsp} +

=== Part controller

For the Part controller, we don't need any more than this in this example:

.site/parts/multi-color/multi-color.es6:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----

const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function(request) {
    const component = portal.getComponent();

    const clientRender = !component.config.SSR       <!--1-->

    const colors = (component.config.colors || [])   <!--2-->
        .map( c => (c || '').trim())
        .filter(c => !!c);

    return React4xp.render(
        "MultiColor",                                <!--3-->
        { colors },
        request,
        { clientRender }
    );
};
----
<1> Taking the serverside-rendering checkbox from the Part's config, and turning it into a `clientRender` flag that's sent into the _options_ argument <<1-hello-react#_client_side_rendering, just like before>>.
<2> Creating a `colors` array of the color names from the Part's config, trimming them and removing empty ones. This is passed into the _props_ argument <<2-editorial-data-and-props#, like before>>.
<3> This argument is slightly different compared to previously. `"MultiColor"` is a <<jsxpath#, jsxPath>> to an entry, as you'd expect. But why does it look so... naked? Where does it point to? As we'll see <<#webpack_config, in a moment>>, we'll set up react4xp to look for entries below an `entryDir` in react4xp.properties: _src/main/resources/react4xp/myEntries/_. Since a jsxPath is relative to the closest parent `entryDir` and we'll put an entry _MultiColor.jsx_ at the root of _entries/_, the jsxPath becomes just the clean file name.



{zwsp} +

== The _MultiColor_ entry
Before we do the react4xp / webpack configuration, we'll make *the _MultiColor.jsx_ entry* and its dependencies.

This is a more complex entry than before (and the most complex part of this example) - it's composed of main react code that *imports secondary dependencies*.

{zwsp} +

=== React component

This is a *stateful* react component that not only *imports and nests secondary react components*, but also imports *styling* - both its own specific and shared general styling - and relies on webpack and react4xp to handle all the compilation and assets behind the scenes.

.src/main/resources/react4xp/myEntries/MultiColor.jsx:

        super(props);
        this.state = {
            selected: 0                                 <!--5-->
        };

        this.shiftUp = this.shiftUp.bind(this);         <!--6-->
        this.shiftDown = this.shiftDown.bind(this);
    }

    shiftUp() {                                         <!--7-->
        this.setState({
            selected: (this.state.selected + 1) % this.props.colors.length

    };

    render() {
        const props =  this.props;
        const state = this.state;
        return props.colors.length ?                    <!--8-->
            <div className="multi-color">

    }
}

                                                        <!--13-->
export default (props) => <MultiColor {...props} />;
----
<1> The entry imports some secondary react components for nesting later. These imports have nothing to do with react4xp's <<jsxPath#, jsxPaths>>, this is *regular ES6 module importing* and will be handled by webpack at compile time and served to the client at runtime. Basically any react component can be imported from anywhere here, including other entries. In this case we're referring to components below a different folder, _shared/_, which we will <<#webpack_config, later>> mark as a *chunk directory* instead of an entry directory. _Shared/_ is not below _entries/_ (but adjacent to it), so these imported react components will not be entries, just secondary react components and not reachable with `React4xp.render`. As you will see, this *folder separation* is also important for the compiled outcome: the entry, _MultiColor.jsx_, will be compiled into _assets/react4xp/MultiColor.js_, but *imported components* like this will be collected inside a common *dependency chunk*: _assets/react4xp/shared.<HASH>.js_. React4xp and webpack track the dependency connections between an entry and all its required chunks - so `React4xp.render` automatically generates asset-loading page contributions from the controller. The outcome: when the webpack rules are set up correctly later, *imports like this in entries rendered by react4xp are all that's needed to connect the entries to the additional assets they might need*: no manual url handling in the controller or thymeleaf views etc. Dependency chunks are also  optimized for repeated use (more details on <<chunks#, dependency chunks>>).
<2> This applies to styling too. Here, the entry imports some specific styling of its own, from a SASS file in the _entries/_ folder. This import is webpack-centric syntax too: the SASS in _MultiColor.scss_ is compiled to the asset _assets/react4xp/Multicolor.css_, and automatically added when using this entry (of course, there's more than one way to handle styling in webpack, this is just one working example).
<3> Another SASS styling import, this time not from the same folder but from the _shared/_ folder. Just like with compiled JS chunks, all imported styling below _shared/_ will be compiled into the dependency chunk _assets/react4xp/shared.<HASH>.css_ - again automatically handled.
<4> Unlike previous examples, this is an old-school stateful react Component with class syntax. See also (13).
<5> The `selected` state attribute keeps track of which of the colors is currently selected, by index number in the `props.colors` array. In regular react fashion, each time this is changed the component is re-rendered.
<6> This makes the whole `MultiColors` class available as `this` also inside the functions `shiftUp` and `shiftDown`.
<7> `shiftUp` and `shiftDown` change the `selected` state attribute, increasing/decreasing it by 1 and wrapping around the array edges.
<8> If no colors have been added editorially, the part just displays an _"Add some color!"_ paragraph. (12). Otherwise, the actual active content is rendered:
<9> Two buttons, increasing and decreasing the selected color. This uses the imported `Button` component from (1) twice. Two different labels and onClick functions are mapped to them, and they are both given a `my-button` HTML class for styling.
<10> The import `ActiveColorOval` is given the currently selected color string, and displays it in an elliptic label on the page.
<11> Next, a list of buttons collected in a `ColorButtons` component. It's given the list of colors and the currently selected index (5), as well as a function that changes the selection index. All in all: click the a color's button to select it.
<12> The fallback rendering if no colors have been added (5).`
<13> Remember that <<entries#_how_to_make_an_entry, entries need to export a function>>: `(props?) => react component`. Since this component is written in the class syntax (4), it needs to be wrapped like this for export.

=== Dependencies for the entry
==== Styling
Now, with the entry done, we can look at the *entry's styling* - a lot simpler, only the buttons' class `my-button` is targeted and styled:

.src/main/resources/react4xp/myEntries/MultiColor.scss:
[source,sass,options="nowrap"]
----
.my-button {
    padding: 16px 35px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    font-weight: bold;
    margin: 10px 40px;
}
----

{zwsp} +

*Moving on to the _shared/_ folder*, this is where we find source files that will be compiled into common assets: dependency chunks with the _"shared"_ prefix and a content-dependent _"<HASH>"_ (reminder: this will happen because we later will mark _shared/_ as a `chunkDir` in _react4xp.properites_).

First, some *_shared-styles.scss_*, also imported by the entry _MultiColor.jsx_. This could for example serve as common, normalizing styling imported by many react components across wide parts of a site:

.src/main/resources/react4xp/shared/shared-styles.scss:
[source,sass,options="nowrap"]
----
* {
  font-family: 'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 15pt;
}
----

{zwsp} +

==== Imported react components
Next, _shared/_ also contains the *secondary react components* imported by  _MultiColor.jsx_. Note how each of them imports their own specific styling the same way as the entry _MultiColor.jsx_.

NOTE: It's important that these react components are *not <<entries#, entries>>* themselves. They are only imported by the MultiColor entry - hence the folder name _shared/_.

{zwsp} +

===== Button
There's the generic *Button* component. This is used both by _MultiColor.jsx_ and the secondary component _ColorButtons.jsx_. It gets custom onClick function, HTML class, inline styling (for single-button-specific attributes) and label (`children`) from `props` (the spread-out function parameters):


.src/main/resources/react4xp/shared/Button.jsx:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

import './Button.scss';    <!--1-->

export default ({clickFunc, className, style, children}) =>
    <button className={className}
            type="button"
            onClick={clickFunc}
            style={style}
    >
        {children}
    </button>;
----
<1> The specific Button styling it imports is marginal - this is just a generic button, so most of the styling is left to the class it's given, or inline attributes:

.src/main/resources/react4xp/shared/Button.scss:
[source,sass,options="nowrap"]
----
button {
  cursor:pointer;
}
----

{zwsp} +

===== ActiveColorOval
Then there's the *ActiveColorOval* component, which just displays `props.color` inside a circle/ellipse thing, filled with the same color:

.src/main/resources/react4xp/shared/ActiveColorOval.jsx:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

import './ActiveColorOval.scss';

export default ({color}) =>
    <div className="active-color-oval"
         style={{backgroundColor: color}}
    >
        {color}
    </div>
----

.src/main/resources/react4xp/shared/ActiveColorOval.scss:
[source,sass,options="nowrap"]
----
.active-color-oval {
  margin: 10px 40px;
  background-color: transparent;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  float: right;
  color: white;
}
----

{zwsp} +

===== ColorButtons
And finally a *ColorButtons* component. It takes the list of `props.colors` (from the editorial data), and assigns each of them to a `Button` labeled with the color, each of them triggering the change-color-selection from _MultiColor.jsx_ with its own specific color index `i` in the list of colors. In addition, the HTML class name(s) of the buttons is assigned dynamically: the buttons all have a `color-button` class, and each item checks if its own array index `i` matches the current `selectedIndex`. If it does, the class `selected` is added, making that button differently styled:

.src/main/resources/react4xp/shared/ColorButtons.jsx:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

import Button from './Button';

import './ColorButtons.scss';

export default ({colors, selectedIndex, clickFunc}) =>
    <ul className="color-list">
        {colors.map( (color, i) =>

            <li key={i} className="color">
                <Button className={`color-button${i === selectedIndex ? ' selected' : ''}`}
                        clickFunc={ ()=>clickFunc(i) }
                        style={{backgroundColor: color, borderColor: color}}
                >
                    {color}
                </Button>
            </li>

        )}
    </ul>;
----

.src/main/resources/react4xp/shared/ColorButtons.scss:
[source,sass,options="nowrap"]
----
.color {
  width: 50%;
  list-style-type: none;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

.color-button {
  min-width: 100%;
  padding: 6px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: 1px solid black;

  &:focus {
    outline: none;
  }

  &.selected {
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  &:not(.selected) {
    background-color: white !important;
  }
}

[[webpack_config]]
== Configuring react4xp and webpack

In this section we'll adjust some settings to make the code above work.

TIP: Some of this is covered in more detail under <<entries#, entries>> and <<jsxpath#, jsxPaths>>.

{zwsp} +

=== Folders for entries and chunks

First, open _react4xp.properties_ in your project root and add/look up the attributes `entryDirs` and `chunkDirs`. Make sure `myEntries` are added as an `entryDir` and `shared` is added as a `chunkDir`.


.react4xp.properties:
[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
entryDirs = myEntries   <!--1-->

chunkDirs = shared    <!--2-->
----
<1> `entryDirs` is a list of where react4xp will look for source files to compile and serve as entries: in this case _src/main/resource/react4xp/myEntries_. This list is *in addition* to XP's _site/_ folder - _site/_ always acts as a sort of default, special-case entryDir: under _site/_ only .JSX files are picked up as entries, while in all other entryDirs, .ES6 and .JS are picked up as well.
<2> `chunkDirs` is a list of folders that will be turned into collection/library assets (dependency chunks): in this case _src/main/resource/react4xp/shared_. One chunk asset for each file type in each chunkDir, named after the chunkDir.

So in our example here, JSX files under _myEntries/_ are available to `React4xp.render` and friends, in XP controllers. Each entry becomes an asset file in itself.

And everything they import from under _shared/_ and that is compiled into JS (both react and otherwise), will be collected into the chunk `shared.<HASH>.js` - and everything under _shared/_ that's compiled into CSS (our SASS, for example) is collected into `shared.<HASH>.css`. And so on.

[NOTE]
====
Both `entrydirs` and `chunkDirs` are comma-separated *lists of relative paths*. They are relative to _src/main/resource/react4xp/_.

Adding paths like e.g. `foo/bar/baz` or `../../hey/ho/lets/go` is perfectly fine (_src/main/resource/react4xp/foo/bar/baz_ and _src/main/hey/ho/lets/go_, respectively).
====

{zwsp} +

=== Adding webpack rules
Next, we'll add some *custom webpack rules to handle the style imports*. First, we need to tell react4xp to use an extra webpack config file. Return to _react4xp.properties_ to add another property:

.react4xp.properties:
[source,properties,options="nowrap"]
----
overrideComponentWebpack = webpack.config.react4xp.js
----

Now we can add our own webpack rules to the react4xp asset compilation and handling:

.webpack.config.react4xp.js:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = function(env, config) {                     <!--1-->

    // This makes 'npm link' symlinks in node_modules work:
    config.resolve.symlinks = true;

    // Compile .scss and friends:
    config.module.rules = [                                  <!--2-->
        ...(config.module.rules || []),
        {
            test: /\.((sa|sc|c))ss$/i,
            use: [
                MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
                {
                    loader: 'css-loader',
                    options: {
                        importLoaders: 1,
                        modules: { auto: true },
                    }
                },
                {
                    loader: 'sass-loader',
                    options: {
                        sassOptions: {
                            outputStyle: 'compressed',
                        },
                    },
                }
            ]
        }
    ];

    // Set up how the compiled assets are exported:
    config.plugins = [
        ...(config.plugins || []),
        new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
            filename: '[name].css',
            chunkFilename: '[id].[contenthash:9].css',
        }),
    ];

    return config;                                           <!--3-->
};
----
<1> Currently, the whole file *must export a function* where the arguments are a standard webpack `env` object, and `config` which is the existing webpack config object from react4xp.
<2> That function may *mutate (or replace!) the react4xp webpack `config` object* (on this line and later: "take any incoming `config.module.rules` and add this style-compilation-rule object"). So previously existing attributes will be overwritten by the new ones from this file.
<3> The function *must return the changed (or replaced) config object*.

And that's the last of it. We're ready to look at it running.

{zwsp} +

== Setup and rendering

Build again and add the _multi-color_ Part in Content Studio, <<3-pages-parts-and-regions#adding_parts_to_new_content, the same way as before>>.

.Empty multicolor Part:
image:multicolor-add.png[title="Empty MultiColor part in Content Studio", width=720px]

{zwsp} +

Click it in edit mode to edit the Part config. Here you can choose to render the part in serverside or clientside mode, as well as enter any number of colors. As long as they are link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors[standard web colors], they will create an array of colored buttons.

.Multicolor Part with colors filled in:
image:multicolor-added.png[title="MultiColor part in Content Studio, with four colors added", width=720px]

{zwsp} +

Outside of Content Studio, in the preview, the buttons are of course active and clickable. Each button selects itself, the Previous/Next buttons cycle through them, and the little elliptic label (the ActiveColorOval) is updated with both text and color:

.Multicolor Part, active view:
image:multicolor-preview.png[,title="MultiColor part outside of Content Studio, active view after clicking the #5d0015 button", width=720px]

{zwsp} +


== Output
Let's take a look at the rendered response from the controller and underline a few things that by now might be as you expected:

.Page source from the Multicolor Part, active view (serverside rendered not selected):
[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title>MultColor</title>

        <!--1-->
        <link href="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/shared.9fa09c20d.css"
              rel="stylesheet"
              type="text/css"/>
        <link href="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/MultiColor.css"
              rel="stylesheet"

----
<1> Firstly, the SASS files have all been compiled to .CSS assets, and stylesheet links to them are inserted into the header by `React4xp.render` (if we had used the <<5-custom-flow-syntax#, custom flow syntax>>, this would have been handled by `.renderPageContributions`). And secondly: while `MultiColor.scss` was compiled into a .CSS file by itself (because the source file is under the entryDir _entries/_), we see that all the other imported assets have been compiled into the common dependency chunk _shared.<HASH>.css_ (_not_ because they were imported by .JSX files under _shared/_ - the import location doesn't matter. But because the .SCSS source files were under _shared/_).
<2> Again, since we didn't check the "Server-side rendering" checkbox, the `clientRender` flag became true and we got a clientside rendering. So this is just the target container element, filled in by the browser on `React4xp.CLIENT.render` below. Had we checked the checkbox, this would have contained the pre-rendered MultiColor entry, of course.
<3> Among the dependencies are still the externals, the client wrapper code and the code to the compiled MultiColor entry. And in addition, there's the `shared.<HASH>.js` dependency chunk, containing the compiled code for all the ES6/JS/JSX found under the _shared/_ folder.

That concludes the lessons!

If you haven't already, it's recommended to take a look at the additional explanations of central concepts and API, in the documentation below - especially the dependency chunks which are used for optimization, as we touched upon in this chapter:


-> <<entries#, Entries>>

-> <<jsxpath#, JsxPath>>

-> <<chunks#, Dependency chunks>>
